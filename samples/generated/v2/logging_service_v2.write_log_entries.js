   *  entries in this list that do not include values for their corresponding
   *  fields. For more information, see the
   *  LogEntry google.logging.v2.LogEntry  type.
   *  If the `timestamp` or `insert_id` fields are missing in log entries, then
   *  this method supplies the current time or a unique identifier, respectively.
   *  The supplied values are chosen so that, among the log entries that did not
   *  supply their own values, the entries earlier in the list will sort before
   *  the entries later in the list. See the `entries.list` method.
   *  Log entries with timestamps that are more than the
   *  logs retention period (https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas) in
   *  the past or more than 24 hours in the future will not be available when
   *  calling `entries.list`. However, those log entries can still be exported
   *  with
   *  LogSinks (https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/tasks/exporting-logs).
   *  To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the
   *  quota limit (https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas) for calls to
   *  `entries.write`, you should try to include several log entries in this
   *  list, rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.
